GEOX · Sprint 17 Patch (Implementation-only)

This patch adds only new implementation-layer scripts + documentation.
It does NOT modify:
- AO-ACT v0 contracts/schemas
- Judge/Agronomy read boundaries and determinism discipline
- Repo-const ruleset governance or kernel loading discipline

Added files
- docs/controlplane/GEOX-CP-AO-ACT-ExecutorAdapter-v0.md
- scripts/ao_act_executor/ao_act_client_v0.cjs
- scripts/ao_act_executor/receipt_builder_v0.cjs
- scripts/ao_act_executor/device_gateway_stub_v0.cjs
- scripts/ao_act_executor/ao_act_executor_sim_v0.cjs
- scripts/ao_act_executor/ao_act_executor_device_v0.cjs
- scripts/ACCEPTANCE_AO_ACT_EXECUTOR_V0.ps1
- scripts/ACCEPTANCE_AO_ACT_EXECUTOR_V0_RUNNER.cjs

How to run acceptance (Windows / PowerShell)
- Ensure apps/server is running and reachable.
- powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\ACCEPTANCE_AO_ACT_EXECUTOR_V0.ps1

Expected outcome
- Creates a task, runs sim executor to write a receipt, verifies via index.
- Creates a task, runs device executor (with local stub gateway) to write a receipt, verifies via index.
- Verifies a negative guard: only /task, /receipt, /index are called by the executor adapters (via shared request log).

Artifacts
- Acceptance writes under: acceptance/ao_act_executor_v0_<timestamp>/
  - summary.json
  - request_log.jsonl
  - per-case stdout/stderr and task responses
